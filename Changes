This file documents the revision history for Perl extension OpusVL::AppKit.

0.20

* Moved the date_short, date_long, time_short and time_long DateTime formatting functions
  to the controller (via OpusVL::AppKit::RolesFor::Controller::GUI) and update the macros
  to call those functions so that we have consistency.  You can now access those functions
  from both your controllers and your TT templates.
* Fixed the module version number reporting so if you do perl -MOpusVL::AppKit\ 9999 it will
  report the correct version number.

0.19

* Added a facility for managing which roles can manage other roles.  This allows users to 
  manage roles without needing to have them assigned.  See bug 235 for more details.
  Two new tables have been added to support this facility.  The need to be added to your
  appkit auth schema.

  CREATE TABLE roles_allowed 
  (
      role integer not null references role(id) on delete cascade, 
      role_allowed integer not null references role(id) on delete cascade, 
      primary key (role, role_allowed)
  );
  CREATE TABLE role_admin
  (
      role_id integer not null references role(id) on delete cascade, 
      primary key(role_id)
  );


0.18

* Changed submit button to say save on user roles saving.
* Added a not_found action for producing a 404 because default isn't terribly logical.

0.17

* Now allow portlets to not be displayed.  All they need to do is return a status of 404
  for their response.  i.e. $c->res->status(404);.  Be careful with calls to detach within
  the portlets because they may cause the whole process to break down.  The Portlet 
  construction is done by the index page 'visiting' each portlet as if it was a page and then
  constructing it's page from all of their responses.

0.16 

* Added support for case insensitive logins

0.15

* Added human readable 404 and 403 pages.  Do a forward to /default and /access_denied to use them.
* Added a password reset feature.
* If a user is logged in and tries to access a page they aren't allowed to they will
  be shown 403 instead of a login screen so that it's clearer that they aren't
  allowed access.

0.14

The previous revisions changes are rolled up into this release for simplicity.

* Resized the images for the buttons so long buttons don't glitch.
* Disabled copy to clipboard function on tables in linux (because it didn't work).
* Tidy up <title> tag on pages using a combination of the template and javascript.
* Prevent users from being able to create a blank role.
* Wide applications menu should no longer visually glitch.
* A subtle application version number footer is now possible by turning on 
  the appkit_display_app_version parameter
* Added a facility to allow the AppKitForm attribute to be extended to allow 
  an attribute to be generated that doesn't call process on the form.
* Added a facility to poke in a bit of HTML content as 'before_content' before 
  the application_body div.
* Tweaked the JSON view to just expose the json stash key.
* Added a pager control.  Simply process pager.tt, i.e,
  [% PROCESS pager.tt pager = mypager %]
* Login process now redirects the user to the page they were trying to access before.
* Fixed a bug where the appkit menu on the left wouldn't display if there was only a 
  single element.
* Added a facility to allow the menu options from multiple controllers to be merged
  using by setting the appkit_shared_module property on the controllers to the same
  string.
* Added a facility to allow for pages to be available to users that aren't logged in.
  To do this create a role called PUBLIC.
* Improved the change password dialog so that it asks for your original password before
  allowing you to change your password.
* Added a simple XML view that makes use of XML::Simple.
* Added a stylesheet for printing that hides most of the chrome.
* Added missing dependencies to the makefile.
* Improved the test coverage.
