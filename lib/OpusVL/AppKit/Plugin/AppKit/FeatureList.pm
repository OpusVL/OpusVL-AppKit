=head1 NAME

OpusVL::AppKit::Plugin::AppKit::FeatureList;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object to manage the features in AppKit to provide a less granular view of our access control 
system.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $features = OpusVL::AppKit::Plugin::AppKit::FeatureList->new;

=head1 METHODS

=cut

use Moose;

has _features           => ( is => 'rw'       , isa => 'HashRef', default => sub { {}; } );
has _path_to_feature    => ( is => 'rw'       , isa => 'HashRef', default => sub { {}; } );

=head2 add_action

Pass it an action from the controller and it will read the features it is part of and store
the details.

=cut
sub add_action
{
    my $self = shift;
    my $app = shift;
    my $action = shift;

    my $features = $action->attributes->{AppKitFeature};
    return if !$features || !@$features;
    for my $feature (@$features)
    {
        $self->_add_to_feature($app .'/'. $feature, $action->reverse);
    }
    my @app_and_feature = map { $app .'/'. $_ } @$features;
    $self->_path_to_feature->{$action->reverse} = \@app_and_feature;
}

sub _add_to_feature
{
    my ($self, $feature, $action) = @_;

    if(!defined $self->_features->{$feature})
    {
        $self->_features->{$feature} = { actions => [], roles_allowed => [] };
    }
    push @{$self->_features->{$feature}->{actions}}, $action;
}

=head2 set_roles_allowed

Allows you to set the roles allowed to access a feature.

=cut
sub set_roles_allowed
{
    my ($self, $feature, $roles) = @_;

    my $f = $self->_features->{$feature};
    $f->{roles_allowed} = $roles if $f;
}

=head2 roles_allowed_for_action

Returns a list of roles allow to access an action path.

=cut
sub roles_allowed_for_action
{
    my $self = shift;
    my $action_path = shift;

    my $features = $self->_path_to_feature->{$action_path};
    return [] if !$features || !@$features;
    my @roles = map { @{$self->_features->{$_}->{roles_allowed} } } @$features;
    return \@roles;
}

=head2 feature_list

Returns a hash containing the feature names and their allowed roles.

=cut
sub feature_list
{
    my $self = shift;
    my $current_role = shift;

    # return a list of Feature name -> [roles allowed]
    my %map;
    my @keys = keys %{$self->_features};
    if($current_role)
    {
        # filter it down to a yes/no type deal.
        %map = map { $_ => scalar grep { $current_role eq $_ } @{$self->_features->{$_}->{roles_allowed}} } @keys;
    }
    else
    {
        %map = map { $_ => $self->_features->{$_}->{roles_allowed} } @keys;
    }
    # now split the map up some more.
    my %apps = map { $_ =~ q|^(.*)/(.*)$|; $1 => { $2 => $map{$_} } } sort keys %map;
    return \%apps;
}
